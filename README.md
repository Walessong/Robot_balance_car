# Robot_balance_car
BUAA2025智创大赛的一个参赛项目，我们以STM32为主控实现了一个平衡小车，可在狭小空间进行空气检测和火灾隐患排查。/This is a project participating in the 2025 Electronic Innovation Competition of Beihang University. We used STM32 as the main control to realize a balancing car that can perform air detection and fire hazard inspection in a small space.
